Chicago Eats was developed by Stephanie Hernandez as part of a full-stack cloud and frontend development course at Illinois Tech. The application is built using React 18, Vite, React Router, and CSS Modules, with form validation and reusable UI components throughout the project. The site is deployed on AWS S3 with continuous deployment handled through GitHub Actions.

This project focuses on real-world development skills:

scalable component structure

mobile-responsive layouts

data-driven restaurant listings

form validation + user-friendly error messages

AWS-based static web hosting

accessibility and clean UI/UX

The goal is to provide visitors a smooth experience while showcasing technical competency and professional development practices.
